# Student Data Management System 📚

A console-based Student Data Management System built using Python.  
This project allows users to manage student records efficiently using file handling and demonstrates core Python concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, and exception handling.

---
## 📌 Project Overview
The system stores student information in a text file and provides options to add, view, search, update, and delete student records through a menu-driven interface.

This project is suitable for beginners and BCA students who want hands-on experience with real-world Python programming.

---
## Why This Project?
This project was created to practice real-world Python concepts such as:
- File handling
- CRUD operations
- Input validation
- Exception handling

It is designed for beginners and BCA students who want to move beyond basic Python programs.
